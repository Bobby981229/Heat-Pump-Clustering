# Heat-Pump-Clustering
This project is a major set of trials based on the Energy Demand Research Project (EDRP) dataset, providing customers with improved feedback on their energy consumption of heat pumps. It is designed to help better understand how domestic consumers react to improved information about their energy consumption over the long term.
